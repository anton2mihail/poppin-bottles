# Bottle Algorithm 
#### Based on a fake supermarket who has these rules
* For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
* For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
* Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase
* Outputs how many total bottles of pop can be redeemed given a customer investment.


## How to Use
* Clone and download this repository to your local machine.
* Open a terminal/console in the folder that contains the entry.js file 
* Type `npm start {}` and replace the {} with the total investment that you're testing

## What it does
* The program outputs to the console the total number of bottles the company can recycle, as well as the total number of bottles that you redeemed on your investment.
